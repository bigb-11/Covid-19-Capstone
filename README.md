# Covid-19-Capstone: Predicting COVID-19 ICU Admissions
B. Brown

In this assignment, I was tasked to perform a full lifecycle Machine Learning Model Development according to the objective of the dataset.

"Brazil has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 16 million confirmed cases and 454 429 confirmed deaths as of May 26, 2021. The country was unprepared for the pandemic, and was unable to respond adequately due to the strain on hospital capacity.

A data science team at a top-tier hospital in Brazil has released a dataset on the Kaggle platform which seeks interesting solutions and findings from the public. The team is using ML to help reduce the strain on hospital's ICU beds, where the objective is to develop a ML model to predict if a patient of a confirmed COVID-19 case will require admission to the ICU.

The dataset collected for the research is publicly available on the data science platform Kaggle. A full description of the dataset can be found on the platform:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/S%C3%ADrio-Libanes/covid19

Tasks & Deliverables
* Conduct EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to gain an understanding of the Data
* Preprocess the Data to prepare it for the ML Model
* Develop a few candidate ML models and pick the most promising one. Evaluate it based on a variety of metrics as well as analysing itâ€™s performance (does it overtrain, can we improve it by changing our data preprocessing etc.)"

## Getting Started with EDA:
I coverted the downloaded dataset to csv, and uploaded to SQL Server to create a database.  Using SQL queries, I created multiple tables to help me understand the relationships in and among the data points.
